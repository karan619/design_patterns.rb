#### What is this repository for?

This repository contains the most common Design Patterns that were implemented in Java by the `Gang of Four` (GOF) in Ruby.

It also contains `Scenario` for every pattern so you can identify in which situations the patterns can be actually useful in the future.

Test Suite is included with every pattern so that you can see the code flow and what is expected.
